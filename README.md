This is a Scientific Calculator built using the C programming language. It supports a range of mathematical operations including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithmic calculations, power and root functions, and more.

This project was developed as a beginner-level project and is my first project in C programming. It helped me understand the fundamentals of C such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and mathematical libraries like math.h.
